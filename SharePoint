        i) [Configure basic authentication][9] for claims-based web application in sharepoint
        Basic authentication enables a web browser to provide credentials when the browser makes a request during an HTTP transaction. Because user credentials are not encrypted for network transmission but are sent over the network in plaintext, we do not recommend that you use basic authentication over an unsecured HTTP connection. To use basic authentication, you should enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for the web site; otherwise, the credentials can be intercepted by a malicious user.
